[[_create_a_sso_service_plan_uaa_tenant]]
Create a SSO Service Plan/UAA Tenant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  In Ops Manager, verify that the SSO Service is installed. There
should be a Pivotal Single Sign-On tile. If not, you will need to
install it before starting this lab.
2.  In Apps Manager, verify that you have a space in the `system` org
named `identity-service-space`. Click on the link to the
`identity-service-broker`. The link should be
`p-identity.[system_domain]`.
3.  Log in with Ops Manager > Pivotal Elastic Runtime > Credentials >
UAA Admin Credentials. This brings up the dashboard for the Pivotal
Single Sign-On (SSO) service.
4.  Click on `New Plan` to create a SSO service plan/tenant. Name the
plan `CustomerAppSSOPlan1`. If you are sharing a Cloud Foundry
installation, append your initials to the plan name.
5.  For Description, enter `Customer apps SSO 1`.
6.  For Auth Domain, enter 'sso1'. If you are sharing a Cloud Foundry
installation, append your initials to the Auth Domain name.
7.  For Instance Name, enter `Customer App SSO Plan 1`.
8.  Under `Org Visibility`, select your org. You could also use
`cf enable-service-access` to make the SSO Service available to your
org.
9.  Click `Create Plan`. You have now created a tenant on the
UAA/Pivotal Single Sign-On service.
10. Click on the plan, then `Manage User Stores`. Notice that you are
using the Internal User Store.

Congratulations, you have created a SSO service plan/UAA tenant and made
it available to your org.

[[_create_a_service_instance]]
Create a Service Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  In Apps Manager, click on the Marketplace. Notice that your plan is
available under Pivotal Single Sign-On. Notice that the first item under
Plan Features is what you typed in `Description` when creating the plan.
2.  Click `Select this plan` Create a SSO Service instance in your
development space. Name the instance `SSO instance 1`. You do not need
to bind it to an application yet. Click `Add` to bind the service to
your space.

Congratulations, you have created an SSO service instance in your
development space.

[[_create_an_oauth_client_on_the_service_plan_uaa_tenant]]
Create an OAuth Client on the Service Plan/UAA Tenant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Click `Manage` on the SSO Service instance to bring up the dashboard
for the service instance.
2.  Click on `New App` to begin the process of creating an OAuth Client
on the UAA tenant that you just created.
3.  Name the app `client_credentials OAuth Client 1`.
4.  Click on the `Service-to-Service App` circle. This will create an
OAuth client on the UAA with grant_type="client_credentials".
5.  Click `Create App` to create an OAuth client of type
client_credentials on your new tenant of the UAA.
6.  The `App ID` textbox contains the ClientID of the OAuth client on
the UAA tenant. Your OAuth-aware application will need this ID.
7.  The `App Secret` textbox contains the ClientSecret, which is also
needed by your OAuth-aware application. Notice that the secret is only
displayed once.
8.  Copy the App ID and App Secret into a text document. Separate the
two values with a colon.
9.  Convert the combined values into a base64-encoded value using
https://www.base64encode.org/ This is what you will use in the curl
statement below. Substitute [base64 encoded value] with this value.
10. You will also use the [OAuth Token URL] in the curl statement below.
11. As a test of the OAuth client on the UAA tenant, retrieve a token
using by entering the `[OAuth Token URL]?grant_type=client_credentials`
into your browser. You will be prompted for the username and password,
enter the Client ID and the Client Secret values respectively. You
should see a page as shown below with your token.

Alternatively you could also use the following curl command. **Make sure
that there are not extra characters in the request**:

....
curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -X POST '[OAuth Token URL]' -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' -H "Authorization: Basic [base64 encoded value]" -k
....

For example:

....
curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -X POST 'https://sso2.login.system.steve.ed.pcfdemo.com/oauth/token' -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' -H "Authorization: Basic MGE5MDFiNDctOWJkZC00NzI1LWE1ZDgtMzIzNjNkZGQ3ZjMxOjdkMGY3ZTUyLWRjYWEtNDY3NS1hOGQxLTNjZDE5OWRlZGMxMw==" -k
....

Congratulations, you have set up a service plan/tenant, an OAuth client
on the UAA and obtained a token from the OAuth Client. If you have time,
enable security on an app by binding it to the service instance and
setting the GRANT_TYPE environment variable for the application to
“client_credentials”. You would then make the application OAuth-aware.
You can also use the Spring Boot sample apps provided here:
